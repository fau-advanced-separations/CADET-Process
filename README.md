# CADET-Process

The [**CADET**](https://cadet.github.io) core simulator is a very powerful numerical engine that can simulate a large variety of physico-chemical models.
However, the configuration files are error prone and can be difficult to work with.
This is especially true when multiple unit operations are involved.
Moreover, the structure of the configuration file can change during process optimization when dynamic switching is involved, making the direct use of **CADET** impossible without another layer of abstraction.

In this context **CADET-Process** was developed.
The package facilitates modeling processes by providing an object oriented model builder.
This interface layer provides convenient access to all model parameters in the system.
It automatically checks validity of the parameter values and provides good default values where possible.
To simplify the setup of dynamic changes of flow sheet connectivity or other parameters, they are defined on completely independent time lines.
To simulate the process, the entire configuration is converted to a regular **CADET** configuration file on demand.

This simplifies the setup of **CADET** simulations and reduces the risk of ill-defined configuration files.
Importantly, **CADET-Process** also facilitates the setup of elaborate switching schemes such as complex gradients, recycling systems, or carousel systems by enabling the definition of event dependencies within the system.

The package also includes tools to evaluate cyclic stationarity of processes, to determine optimal fractionation times, and to calculate common performance indicators such as yield, purity, and productivity.
Moreover, utility functions for calculate reaction equilibria and buffer capacities, as well as convenient functions for plotting simulation results are provided.

Finally, these processes can be optimized by defining an objective function (with constraints) and using one of the integrated optimization algorithms such as NSGA-3.
This can be used to improve process performance or to determine any of the physico-chemical model parameters.
