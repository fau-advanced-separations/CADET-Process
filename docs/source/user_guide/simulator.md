# Process Simulation
To simulate a {class}`~CADETProcess.processModel.Process`, a simulator needs to be configured.
The simulator translates the {class}`~CADETProcess.processModel.Process` configuration into the API of the corresponding external simulator.
As of now, only **CADET** has been adapted but in principle, other simulators can be also implemented.
**CADET** needs to be installed separately for example using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge cadet
```

For more information on **CADET**, refer to the {ref}`CADET Documentation <cadet:contents>`

## Instantiate Simulator
First, {class}`~CADETProcess.simulator.Cadet` needs to be imported.
If no path is specified in the constructor, **CADET-Process** will try to autodetect the **CADET** installation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from CADETProcess.simulator import Cadet
process_simulator = Cadet()
```

If a specific version of **CADET** is to be used, add the install path to the constructor:

```
process_simulator = Cadet(install_path='/path/to/cadet/executable')
```

To verify that the installation has been found correctly, call the {meth}`~CADETProcess.simulator.Cadet.check_cadet` method:

```{code-cell} ipython3
process_simulator.check_cadet()
```

## Simulator Parameters
For all simulator parameters, reasonable default values are provided but there might be cases where those might need to be changed.

### Time Stepping
**CADET** uses adaptive time stepping.
That is, the time step size is dynamically adjusted based on the rate of change of the variables being simulated.
This balances the tradoff between simulation accuracy and computational efficiency by reducing the time step size when the error estimate is larger than a specified tolerance and increasing it when the error estimate is smaller.

After simulation, the solution is interpolated and stored in an array.
To change the resolution of that solution, set the {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SimulatorBase.time_resolution` attribute.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(process_simulator.time_resolution)
```

Note that changing this value does not have an effect on the accuracy of the solution.
To change error tolerances, modify the attributes of the {class}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverTimeIntegratorParameters`

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(process_simulator.time_integrator_parameters)
```

Most notably, {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverTimeIntegratorParameters.abstol` and {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverTimeIntegratorParameters.abstol` might need to be adapted in cases where high accuracy is required.
For more information, see {class}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverTimeIntegratorParameters` and refer to the {ref}`CADET Documentation<cadet:FFSolverTime>`.

### Solver Parameters
The {class}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverParameters` stores general parameters of the solver.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(process_simulator.solver_parameters)
```

Most notably, {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SolverParameters.nthreads` defines the number of threads with which the simulation is parallelized.
For more information, see also {ref}`CADET Documentation<cadet:solver>`.

### Model Solver Parameters
The {class}`~CADETProcess.simulator.ModelSolverParameters` stores general parameters of the model solver.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(process_simulator.solver_parameters)
```

For more information, see also {ref}`CADET Documentation<cadet:FFModelSystem>`.

## Simulate Processes
To run the simulation, pass the {class}`~CADETProcess.processModel.Process` as an argument to the {meth}`~CADETProcess.simulator.Cadet.simulate` method.
For this example, consider a simple {ref}`batch-elution example<batch_elution_example>`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
from examples.batch_elution.process import process

process.add_parameter_sensitivity('column.total_porosity')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
simulation_results = process_simulator.simulate(process)
```

Sometimes simulations can take a long time to finish.
To limit their runtime, add a `timeout` argument with the maximum simulation time in seconds.

```
simulation_results = process_simulator.simulate(process, timeout=300)
```

(simulation_results_guide)=
## Simulation Results
The {class}`~CADETProcess.simulationResults.SimulationResults` object contains the results of the simulation.
This includes:
- `exit_code`: Information about the solver termination.
- `exit_message`: Additional information about the solver status.
- `time_elapsed`: Execution time of simulation.
- `n_cycles`: Number of cycles that were simulated.
- `solution`: Complete solution of all cyles.
- `solution_cycles`: Solution of individual cycles.

In the {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulationResults.solution` attribute, {class}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionBase` objects for each unit operation are stored.
By default, the inlet and outlet of each unit are stored.
To also include other solution types such as bulk or solid phase, this needs to be configured before simulation in the corresponding {mod}`~CADETProcess.processModel.solutionRecorder`.
For more information refer to {ref}`unit_operation_guide`.

All solution objects provide plot methods.
For example, the {meth}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO.plot` method of the {class}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO` class which is used to store the inlets and outlets of unit operations plots the concentration profile over time.

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.inlet.plot()
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.plot()
```

It is also possible to only plot specific components by specifying a list of component names.

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.plot(components=['A'])
```

Moreover, a time interval can be specified with arguments `start` and `end`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.plot(start=5*60, end=9*60)
```

The {class}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO` also provides access to the {attr}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO.derivative` and {attr}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO.antiderivative` of the solution which in turn are also {class}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO` objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
derivative = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.derivative
_ = derivative.plot()
```

If parameter sensitivities have been specified (see {ref}`sensitivity_guide`), the resulting sensitivities are also stored in {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulationResults.SimulationResults.sensitivity` attribute.
This `dict` contains an entry for every sensitivity.
For each of those entries, the sensitivity is stored for each of the unit operations as defined in the corresponding {mod}`CADETProcess.processModel.solutionRecorder` (see {ref}`solution_recorder_guide`).
For example, if `column.total_porosity` has been defined, the structure would look like the following:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(simulation_results.sensitivity.keys())
print(simulation_results.sensitivity['column.total_porosity'].keys())
print(simulation_results.sensitivity['column.total_porosity'].column.keys())
```

Here, the `outlet` entry again is a {class}`~CADETProcess.solution.SolutionIO` which can be plotted.
```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = simulation_results.sensitivity['column.total_porosity'].column.outlet.plot()
```

(stationarity_guide)=
## Cyclic Stationarity
Preparative chromatographic separations are operated in a repetitive fashion.
In particular processes that incorporate the recycling of streams, like steady-state-recycling (SSR) or simulated moving bed (SMB), have a distinct startup behavior that takes multiple cycles until a periodic steady state is reached.
But also in conventional batch chromatography several cycles are needed to attain stationarity in optimized situations where there is a cycle-to-cycle overlap of the elution profiles of consecutive injections.
However, it is not known beforehand how many cycles are required until cyclic stationarity is established.

For this reason, the simulator can simulate a {class}`~CADETProcess.processModel.Process` for a fixed number of cycles, or continue simulating until the {class}`~CADETProcess.stationarity.StationarityEvaluator` (see {ref}`Figure: Framework Overview <framework_overview>`) confirms that cyclic stationarity is reached.
Different criteria can be specified such as the maximum deviation of the concentration profiles or the peak areas of consecutive cycles {cite}`Holmqvist2015`.
The simulation terminates if the corresponding difference is smaller than a specified value.
For the evaluation of the process (see {ref}`fractionation_guide`), only the last cycle is examined, as it yields a representative {class}`~CADETProcess.performance.Performance` of the process in all later cycles.

To demonstrate this concept, consider a SSR process (see {ref}`here <ssr_process>` for the full process configuration).

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

from examples.recycling.mrssr_process import process
```

A first strategy is to simulate multiple cycles at once.
For this purpose, we can specify {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SimulatorBase.n_cycles` for the simulator.

```{code-cell} ipython3
process_simulator.n_cycles = 10
simulation_results = process_simulator.simulate(process)
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.plot()

```
However, it is hard to anticipate, when steady state is reached.
To automatically simulate until stationarity is reached, a {class}`~CADETProcess.stationarity.StationarityEvaluator` needs to be configured.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from CADETProcess.stationarity import StationarityEvaluator

evaluator = StationarityEvaluator()
```

In this example, the relative change in the area of the solution (i.e. the integral of the chromatogram) of succeeding cycles should be compared.
For this purpose, a {class}`~CADETProcess.stationarity.RelativeArea` criterion is configured and added to the Evaluator.
The threshold is set to `1e-3` indicating that the change in area must be smaller than $0.1~\%$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from CADETProcess.stationarity import RelativeArea

criterion = RelativeArea()
criterion.threshold = 1e-3

evaluator.add_criterion(criterion)
```

Then, the evaluator is added to the simulator and the {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SimulatorBase.evaluate_stationarity` flag in the simulator is set to `True`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
process_simulator.stationarity_evaluator = evaluator
process_simulator.evaluate_stationarity = True
```

To prevent running too many simulations (e.g. when stationarity is never reached), it is possible to limit the maximum number of cycles that are evaluated:

```{code-cell} ipython3
process_simulator.n_cycles_max = 100
```

In addition, because stopping the simulation, evaluating the stationarity, and then restarting the simulation comes with some overhead, it is also possible to set a minimum number of cycles that are simulated between evaluations:

```{code-cell} ipython3
process_simulator.n_cycles_min = 10
```

Now the simulator runs until stationarity is reached.

```{code-cell} ipython3
simulation_results = process_simulator.simulate(process)
_ = simulation_results.solution.column.outlet.plot()
```

The number of cycles is stored in the simulation results.
```{code-cell} ipython3
print(simulation_results.n_cycles)
```

It is possible to access the solution of any of the cycles.
For the last cycle, use the index `-1`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = simulation_results.solution_cycles.column.outlet[-1].plot()
```

Note that the simulator by default already contains a preconfigured {class}`~CADETProcess.stationarity.StationarityEvaluator`.
Usually, it is sufficient to only set the {attr}`~CADETProcess.simulator.SimulatorBase.evaluate_stationarity` flag.
