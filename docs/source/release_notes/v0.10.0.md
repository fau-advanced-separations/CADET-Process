# v0.10.0

**CADET-Process** v0.10.0 is the culmination of 7 months of dedicated development and collaboration.
This release introduces significant new features, critical bug fixes, enhanced test coverage, and improved documentation.
We strongly encourage all users to upgrade to this version for better performance and new functionalities.

This release requires Python 3.10+.

## Highlights and new features of this release

### {mod}`CADETProcess.processModel` improvements

- **Support for Unit Operations with Multiple Ports**:
  Enhanced flexibility in modeling systems by introducing support for unit operations that handle multiple input and output ports.

- **Add MCT Model**:
  A new Model for Multicomponent Transport (MCT) is introduced, expanding the capabilities of the library for simulating advanced separation processes.

### {mod}`CADETProcess.comparison` improvements

- **Add Fractionation Metric**:
  A new metric for assessing the fractionation efficiency of processes has been added, improving the comparison and analysis of simulation results.

### {mod}`CADETProcess.simulator` improvements

- **Integration of DG method**:
  Adaptation to the new spatial discontinuous Galerkin discretization method (DG) of CADET-Core, enhancing the computational performance of chromatography models.
  Please refer to our corresponding publication and the updated documentation for information on optimal discretization parameters.
- **Integration of C-API**:
  Adaptation to the new in-memory interface of CADET-Core, improving the speed of simulation startup and writing of solution output.

### {mod}`CADETProcess.optimization` improvements

- **Add qNParEGO Optimization**:
  Integration of the qNParEGO interface, providing support for advanced multi-objective optimization with faster convergence and broader applicability.

- **General Optimization Improvements**:
  Multiple refinements and updates to optimization processes, including improved handling of constraints and optimization problem setup.
